# Minesweeper Extreme
## Harrison Yelton and Louis Labuzienski

## App Description

This is a brand new implementation of Minesweeper with the added bonus of persistant career statistics. This allows players to 
track their personal best time-to-complete at three completely unique difficulty settings. In addtion to these added features,
this version will allow the player to create custom difficulties by controlling the density of bomb location.

This app will implement Sprite Kit to display and update the game board. We will be using Core Graphics for our menu icon.

## Trackable stats include:
* Time spent in-game
* K/D ratio
* Fastest time for difficulty completion
* Total games played
* Flags placed
* **New Feature:** App will track correcty placed flags over career
* Spaces dug
* Bombs Detonated
