### Written Evaluation of A02 Design Documentation
For the most part our design documentation was pretty comprehensive. It covered the basic structure of our app and gave us a 
framework for how we wanted to follow the MVC convention. Most of the issues with our design documents came from not knowing how
a TileMap would interact with a View Controller. Because of this we made several allowances that ended up not contributing

**(1.) MVC -> 0.8 x 0.5 + 1.0 x 0.5 = 90% = 36**

Criterion | Approx. % of Grade | 100 | 80 | 60 | 20 | 0
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Docx. | 50% | Well-prepared & understandable | **A few design aspects missing with good documentation** | Major sections missing or lacking meaningful content with poor documentation | Provided, but lacking content, bad documentation | Nothing
Specs | 50% | **Nothing missing** | Minor violations | Significant Violations | Mostly Missing | All missing

**(2.) UI Elements -> 1.0 x 0.5 + 1.0 x 0.5 = 100% = 30**

Criterion | Approx. % of Grade | 100 | 80 | 60 | 20 | 0
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Docx. | 50% | **Well-prepared & understandable** | A few design aspects missing with good documentation | Major sections missing or lacking meaningful content with poor documentation | Provided, but lacking content, bad documentation | Nothing
Specs | 50% | **Nothing missing** | Minor violations | Significant Violations | Mostly Missing | All missing

**(5.) Frameworks -> 0.8 x 0.5 + 1.0 x 0.5 = 90% = 27**

Criterion | Approx. % of Grade | 100 | 80 | 60 | 20 | 0

### **Design Total: 93**

### Beta Evaluation:

Criterion | Approx. % of Grade | 100 | 80 | 60 | 20 | 0
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Program Correctness | 50% | **No errors, no crashes** | Minor details missing | Many bugs, can't run w/o minor tweaks | Crashes often, major syntax errors | Does not run
Readability | 20% | **Clean & organized** | Minor problems with whitespace, names, or organization | A major problem with whitespace, names, or organization | Many major problems with whitespace, names, or organization | All bad
Specs | 30% | **Nothing missing** | Minor violations | Significant Violations | Mostly Missing | All missing

#### Program Correctness:
We chose this option because it's true. Our app runs without crashing at all times, and all implemented functionality follows our team contract.

#### Readability:
Throughout the process of building our app, we have consistantly written thoughtful comments that describe the fucntionality we wanted, as well as the thought processes we took to get there.

#### Specifications:
All parts of our A03 beta follow the criteria outlined in our team contract.
